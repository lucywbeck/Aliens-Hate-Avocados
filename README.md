# Aliens-Hate-Avocados
Aliens Hate Avocados is a 3D action shooter video game in which players use Avocado ‘Goop Guns’ to defend cows from enemy UFOs! 
UFOs appear in waves and attempt to kidnap cows while firing missiles at players. In the Final Wave, players must face the Boss UFO 
which tries to capture the barn containing all of the cows while simultanously dropping milk bombs and shooting missiles at players. 
UFOs vary in speed and health depending on their color, and will occasionally drop power ups after being destroyed. 
Players must protect cows and defeat the Boss UFO in order to win the game! If all cows are kidnapped, players lose the game. 

# My Contributions
I implemented the UFO zig zag movement, boss UFO, milk bombs, movement tracking missiles, gun mechanisms, powerups, player health/damage callbacks, 
and UI for the leaderboard, player health, & powerups.
